## Summary
- EC2 is like a VM that is hosted in AWS
- Select capacity needed right now
- Grow and shrink when needed
- Pay for what you use
- Wait in minutes rather than months

## Pricing
- On demand - by the hour/second depending on instance type
- Reserved - reserve capacity for 1 or 3 years with 72% discount
- Spot - purchase unused capacity at 90% discount good for apps that have flexible start and end times
- Dedicated - great for compliance requirements

## Instance type
- Determines hardware
- Different compute, memory and storage 
- Grouped in instance family

## EBS volume
- Available and scalable storage volumes attached to EC2 instance
- Elastic Block Store
- SSD - gp2, io1, io2
- HDD - st1, sc1

## EBS snapshots
- point in time copy of EBS volume
- Encrypted snapshots create encrypted volume

## ELB
- Application Load Balancer - intelligent load balancing for HTTP/HTTPS - routes request to specific webserver based on request type
- Network load balanacer - high performance load balancing for TCP traffic
- Classic - legacy
- Gateway load balancer - third party virtual appliances
- X-forwarded-for header if you need IPv4 address
- 504 error - application not responding within timeout period

## Route53
- Amazon DNS service
- Map domain name to EC2, ELB, S3
- Create alias and A record for ELB pointing to EC2
- Hosted Zone - container for DNS record for domain
- Alias - allows route traffic addressed to zone apex or top of DNS name space and send to a resource within AWS
- A record - route traffic to a resource such as webserver using IPv4 address

## AWS CLI
- Least privilege - minimum to do their job
- Use IAM groups
- Group permissions with IAM policy
- Secret access key only see this once. Need to run aws configure again
- Dont share key pairs. Each devs have key pairs
- Supports Linux, Windows MacOS

## EC2 roles
- Used to give EC2 instance access to aws resources
- Create an IAM role
- Create EC2 instance, attach role
- Access S3 from EC2 instance
- This is the preferred option, avoid hard coding credentials
- Provide access without managing access keys and secret
- Use IAM policies to control roles permissions
- Updates with immediate effect
- Attach and detaching roles without stopping EC2 instances

## RDS
- RDS database types
- RDS is for OLTP workloads
- Not for OLAP (use RedShift instead)

## Automated vs DB snapshots
- automated - default, define backup window, point in time snapshots + transaction logs, retention period up to 35 days, recover to any time within retention period
- db snapshot - user initiated, ad hoc, point in time snapshot only, back up db instance to know state before making change to db

## Encryption of RDS
- Enable at creation - encrypt everything backups snapshots logs and read replicas
- Use KMS - AES-256 encryption
- Existing RDS without encryption, take a snapshopt, encrypt snapshopt, create RDS instance

## Multi AZ and read replica
- Multi AZ - exact copy of production db in another AZ for DR. When fail, automatically failover
- Read replica - read only, in same AZ cross AZ or cross region, used to increase scale read performance

## Memcached vs redis
- Elasticache is for improving read performance
- Memcached - In memory key value data store, object caching, simple, dont need multi AZ or persistence or data sorting
- Redis - In memory key value data store, data sorting, advance data types, have data persistence and multi AZ

## Parameter store
- Store confidential information such as passwords, db config, license
- Store as plain text or encrypted
- Reference with parameter name for bootstrap script
- Integrate with AWS services
