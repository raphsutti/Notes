## Definition

- Elastic Block Store
- Storage volumes you can attached to EC2 instances

## Features
- Mission critical - Production workloads, highly available, scalable

## General Purpose SSD (gp2)
- balance of price and performance
- 3 IOPS per GiB, <=16000 IOPS per volume
- 99.9% durability
- boot disks and general applications

## Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)
- 50 IOPS per GiB, 640000 IOPS per volume
- 99.9% durability

## Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2)
- Same price as io1
- Higher durability and more IOPS
- 500 IOPS per GiB, 64000 IOPS per volume
- 99.999% durability
- I/O intensive apps, large dbs, latency sensitive workloads

## Throughput optimized HDD (st1)
- Low-cost HDD volume
- baseline throughput 40 MB/s per TB
- burst up to 250 MB/s per TB
- Maximum throughput 500 MB/s per volume
- 99.9% durability
- cannot be a boot volume
- Big data, data warehouses, ETL, log processing

## Cold HDD (sc1)
- Lowest cost option
- baseline throughput of 12 MB/s per TB
- burst 80 MB/s per TB
- max throughput 250 MB/s per volume
- for colder data with fewer scans per day
- applications with lowest cost and performance not a factor, less frequently accessed
- 99.9% durability
- Cannot be a boot volume

## IOPS vs Throughput

IOPS
- For metric, quick transaction, low latency, transactional workloads
- io1 or io2

Throughput
- Large datasets, large I/O sizes, complex queries
- Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)

## Demo

- EC2 and Volumes need to be in the same availability zones
- Can create volume based on a snapshot
- Encrypted snapshots -> volume will be encrypted when created
