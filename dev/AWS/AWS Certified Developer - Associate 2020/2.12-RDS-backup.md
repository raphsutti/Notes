## Manual Snapshot
- Manual, adhoc, user initiated
- Provides snapshot point in time of storage volume attached to DB instance
- Stored in S3
- Free storage equal to size of database
- Defined backup window - storage IO may be suspended while backup initialised
- No retention period, database can be deleted and snapshot remains
- Backup to a known state

## Automated backup
- Enabled by default
- Scheduled backup during a window defined
- Transactional logs used to replay
- Point in time recovery within 1-35 days retention period
- Full daily backup
- Recovery process - select most recent backup, apply transaction log. Allow point in time recovery down to a second

## Restoring
- Creates new RDS instance with new DNS endpoint

## Encryption at rest
- At creation time, not later on
  - To encrypt an already unencrypted db:
  - Take snapshot (unencrypted)
  - Create encrypted snapshot
  - Perform db restore on encrypted snapshot 
  - Encrpted DB created
- Uses KMS - AWS-256 encryption
- Includes all DB storage - autmated backups, snapshots, logs, read replicas

## Summary
### Automated backup
- Enabled by default
- Point in time snapshot + transaction logs
- Rentention period of 1-35 days
- Recover db to any point in time within rentention period

### DB/Manual snapshot
- User initiated, adhoc
- Point in time snapshot only
- No retention period, stored indefinitely
- Used to backup DB instance to known state and restore to that state at any time eg. before making change to db

### Encryption
- Enabled at creation
- Encrypted all backups, snapshots, logs, read replicas
- KMS integration with AES-256 encryption
- If need to encrypt unencrypted db, take a snapshot, encrypt the snapshot, create new RDS instance from encrypted snapshot
