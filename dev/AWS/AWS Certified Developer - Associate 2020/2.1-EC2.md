## Definition

- Secure, resizable compute capacity in the Cloud
- VM hosted on AWS
- Web-scale cloud computing
- Capacity when you need it
- You have root on your own instances

## Benefits
- Pay only what you use
- No wasted capacity, grow and shrink as needed
- Servers up and running in minutes

Vs on-prem infra
- Estimate capacity
- Long term investment 3-5 years, growing into it

## Pricing
- On demand (default) - pay for the time running
  - Flexible, suitable for short term, unpredictable, testing the water
- Reserved - reserved capacity 1-3 years, <=72% discounts.
  - Good for predictable usage apps, with specific capcity requirement, if you can pay up front
  - Standard reserve instances 72% off
  - Convertible reserve instances 54% off
  - Scheduled reserve instances 
- Spot - purchase unused capactiy <=90% discount depending on demand
  - Set maximum price, actual price fluctuate depending on demand. Instances hibernate or terminate depending on options
  - For an urgent need of large amount of computing sometimes
- Dedicated - Most expensive
  - Compliance, licensing
  - On demand 
  - Reserved for you

## Instance types

- Determines hardware of the host computer
- Capabilities - CPU, memory, storage
- Select based on application requirements

### Various types:
- Micro instances
- General
- FPGA instances
  - Parallel processing power
- GPU instances
- Machine learning ASIC instances
- Memory optimized - databases applications
- Storage optimized

## Launching EC2 demo
Launch new instance with:
- SSH enabled
- Web server enabled

Download key pair pem file for ssh
```
> chmod 400 MyNewKeyPair.pem
> ssh ec2-user@100.25.0.104 -i MyNewKeyPair.pem
The authenticity of host '100.25.0.104 (100.25.0.104)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:lVF5H5eYvXecX1eNoYfSgeYLOZKAtliOHc+G76AzBAY.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '100.25.0.104' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
