# Notes

## Intro

Hello ðŸ‘‹! 
My name is Raph and I am new to the tech industry.
I like learning and taking notes is one of the ways I learn. On top of learning, I also like knowledge sharing so I've decided to create this repo to share with others who are interested.

I'm currently a Software Developer but I also like infosec. This repo will be a mix of dev and sec information.
