https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit19.html

- **Category:** wargames basic

## Challenge

> The password for the next level is stored in a file readme in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc to log you out when you log in with SSH.
Commands you may need to solve this level: ssh, ls, cat

## Solution

Unfortunately you are logged off immediately after you ssh in beofre you can `cat readme`. 

There is a way to run a command with ssh though! From the man page:

```
ssh <destination> [command]
```

`command` is optional and can be provided to do what we need here

1. ssh into `bandit18` with password `kfBf3eYk5BPBRzwjqutbbfE887SVc5Yd` **with** additional `cat` command at the end 
   
```
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 cat readme
