## Challenge

> The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions
Commands you may need to solve this level: grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

## Solution

1. ssh into `bandit11` with password `IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR`
2. Rot13 is a simple substitution cipher where a character is translated 13 letters (eg a->n).
3. We can use `tr` command to substitute characters the way we want. Eg. we can substitute a to n with `tr 'a' 'n'`. The `tr` command also accepts alphabet ranges too eg. `tr 'a-z' 'n-za-m'` which will rotate all characters 13 positions
4. `tr` can also cater for upper case letters eg. `tr 'a-zA-Z' 'n-za-mN-ZA-M'`

Note: Interesting fact, if you apply rot13 twice, you end up at the same character! This is because there are 26 characters in the alphabet.

PS. There are other ways to solve this, there are plenty of tools out there. Google is your friend!
