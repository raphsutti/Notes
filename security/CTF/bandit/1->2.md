## Solution

1. ssh into `bandit1` with password `boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1`
2. Looking in the current directory you will find `-` file
3. `-` has a special meaning in unix world. This is used for redirecting STDIN/STDOUT. Use `cat` and specified current directly `./` to read the file

Note: `cat -` will make the system wait for STDIN and not actually trying to `cat` the file `-`. By specifying `./-` the system realise that `-` is a file name.

```
ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

bandit1@bandit:~$ ls
-
bandit1@bandit:~$ cat ./-
