# Over The Wire: Bandit - 6->7

https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit7.html

- **Category:** wargames basic

## Challenge

> The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:

- owned by user bandit7
- owned by group bandit6
- 33 bytes in size

>Commands you may need to solve this level: ls, cd, cat, file, du, find, grep

## Solution

1. ssh into `bandit6` with password `DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7`
2. Use `find` command again but this time with more flags `-user` and `-group`
3. Redirect `stderr` to `/dev/null` (linux's place equivalent to the recycle bin). This is done using `2>`


```
ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

bandit6@bandit:~$ find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2> /dev/null
/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
bandit6@bandit:~$ cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
