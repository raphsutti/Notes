# Over The Wire: Bandit - 7->8

## Challenge

> The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth
Commands you may need to solve this level: grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

## Solution

1. ssh into `bandit7` with password `HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs`
2. Use `grep` to find the word `millionth` in the file

Note: usage is `grep <word> <file>`.

It is not uncommon for people to use pipe `|` and redirect from `cat`. Ie. `cat <file> | grep <word>`. In this case both works but the first usage is cleaner.

```
ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

bandit7@bandit:~$ grep millionth data.txt
millionth	cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV
