This is a beginner friendly intro to CTFs. I highly recommend everyone to start with this.. and it's free!

If you get stuck, feel free to follow along my writeups. However, I urge you to try at it without looking at the writeups. If you get stuck for way too long then you should look at it for hints.

My hot tip is to use the `man` page. Google is your friend but most time, the answer lies in the `man` page.
