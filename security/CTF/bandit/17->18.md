# Over The Wire: Bandit - 17->18

https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit18.html

- **Category:** wargames basic

## Challenge

> There are 2 files in the homedirectory: passwords.old and passwords.new. The password for the next level is in passwords.new and is the only line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new

> NOTE: if you have solved this level and see ‘Byebye!’ when trying to log into bandit18, this is related to the next level, bandit19.
Commands you may need to solve this level: cat, grep, ls, diff


## Solution

1. ssh into `bandit17` with password `xLYVMN9WE5zQ5vHacb0sZEVqbrp7nBTn`
2. Use the `diff` command to compare the two files. The `---` separates the file

```
ssh bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

bandit17@bandit:~$ diff passwords.old passwords.new
