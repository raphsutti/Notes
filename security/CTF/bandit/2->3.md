## Solution

1. ssh into `bandit2` with password `CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9`
2. Use `cat` and start typing the file name. Use tab completion to autofil which will escape spaces for you.

Note: if you dont escape special characters with `\`, the system will interpret the space as a divider for arguments

```
ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

bandit2@bandit:~$ ls
spaces in this filename
bandit2@bandit:~$ cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
