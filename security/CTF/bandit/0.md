## Challenge

> The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org, on port 2220. The username is bandit0 and the password is bandit0. Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1.

## Solution

Log into the game with `ssh` and use `-p` to specify port

```
ssh <user>@<host> -p <port>
```

```
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

```
No flag for this one - this is to get access to the first level
```
