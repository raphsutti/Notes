# Over The Wire: Bandit - 5->6

https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit6.html

- **Category:** wargames basic

## Challenge

> The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:

- human-readable
- 1033 bytes in size
- not executable

> Commands you may need to solve this level: ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

## Solution

1. ssh into `bandit5` with password `koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh`
2. Use `find` command with the filter for file size. The placeholder `c` after the value sets the value to bytes (you could use other units like `k` for kilobytes)

```
ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

bandit5@bandit:~$ find . -size 1033c
./inhere/maybehere07/.file2
bandit5@bandit:~$ cat inhere/maybehere07/.file2
