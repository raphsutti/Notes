## Challenge

> The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.
Commands you may need to solve this level: grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd


## Solution

1. ssh into `bandit9` with password `UsvVyFSfZZWbi6wgC7dAFyFuR6jQQUhR`
2. Using the `file` command, we can see the file is a data
3. Using `cat` will not show human readable string. A good command here is `strings`
4. After using `strings` we can pipe the data to `grep` to search for ==

```
ssh bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

bandit9@bandit:~$ file data.txt
data.txt: data
bandit9@bandit:~$ strings data.txt | grep ==
