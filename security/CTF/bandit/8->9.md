## Challenge

## Solution

1. ssh into `bandit8` with password `cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV`
2. `uniq` command here is what we need but if you use it by itself now, it wont work because `uniq` omits repeated lines that are next to each other
3. First we need to `sort` the data for `uniq` to work
4. Then we pipe `|` the result to `uniq`

```
ssh bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

bandit8@bandit:~$ sort data.txt | uniq -u
