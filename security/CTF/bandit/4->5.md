- **Category:** wargames basic

## Challenge

> The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.
Commands you may need to solve this level: ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

## Solution

1. ssh into `bandit4` with password `pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB`
2. Use `file` command to see the type of file

Note: instead of using `file` command on each file individually, use a wildcard * to run `file` on every file in that directory

```
ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

bandit4@bandit:~$ file inhere/*
inhere/-file00: data
inhere/-file01: data
inhere/-file02: data
inhere/-file03: data
inhere/-file04: data
inhere/-file05: data
inhere/-file06: data
inhere/-file07: ASCII text
inhere/-file08: data
inhere/-file09: data

bandit4@bandit:~$ cat inhere/-file07
