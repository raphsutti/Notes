## Challenge

> The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.
Commands you may need to solve this level: ssh, telnet, nc, openssl, s_client, nmap

## Solution

1. ssh into `bandit14` with password `4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e`
2. `nc` is the swiss army knife involving TCP or UDP. It can open TCP connections, send UDP packets, listen to ports, do port scanning!
3. For this level we just need to submit the current level password to localhost port 30000 and we can do this by piping the password to `nc <host> <port>`

```
ssh bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

bandit14@bandit:~$ echo "4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e" | nc localhost 30000
Correct!
