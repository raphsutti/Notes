# Over The Wire: Bandit - 21->22

- **Category:** wargames basic

## Challenge

> A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed. Commands you may need to solve this level: cron, crontab, crontab(5) (use “man 5 crontab” to access this)

## Solution

1. ssh into `bandit21` with password `gE269g2h3mw3pwgrj0Ha9Uoqen1c9DGr`
2. Check out the files in `/etc/cron.d/` as specified by the challenge brief
3. The interesting file is the one that ends with `bandit22` (the challenge we are trying to solve)
4. Using `cat` on that cronjob file reveals that a sh script is ran every minute of every hour of everyday (noted by the *). See how this works in [cron wikipedia page](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cron)


```
ssh bandit19@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

bandit21@bandit:~$ ls /etc/cron.d/
cronjob_bandit15_root  cronjob_bandit22  cronjob_bandit24
cronjob_bandit17_root  cronjob_bandit23  cronjob_bandit25_root
bandit21@bandit:~$ cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit22
@reboot bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
```

Let's break down the shell script. Looks like it is changing permissions with `chmod` to 644 (-rw-r--r--) for a weird file in `/tmp` then overwrites it with bandit22's password!

```
bandit21@bandit:~$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh
#!/bin/bash
chmod 644 /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 > /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
```

As you can see, the permission is open for anyone to read.. so we can just `cat` the file!

```
bandit21@bandit:~$ ls -la /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
-rw-r--r-- 1 bandit22 root 33 Mar 28 08:19 /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv

bandit21@bandit:~$ cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
