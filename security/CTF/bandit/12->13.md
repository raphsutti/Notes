# Over The Wire: Bandit - 12->13

https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit13.html

- **Category:** wargames basic

## Challenge

> The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)
Commands you may need to solve this level: grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd, mkdir, cp, mv, file

## Solution

- This one requires a bit of enumeration. You will need several decompression tools such as `tar` `gzip` `bzip`. Stick with it, you'll be relieved when you solve it!
  
- First you need to know what this text file looks like. As the challenge hinted, it is a hexdump
  
![hexdump format](./hexdump.jpg)
  
- You will also need to identify the file type using `file` command 
  
- The challenge also recommends you create a directory in the `/tmp` folder. You can do this with the `mkdir` command and `cd` change directory into the new folder

- You will also need to rename files to appropriate extensions with the `mv` command
  
### Step by step solution

1. ssh into `bandit12` with password `5Te8Y4drgCRfCx8ugdwuEX8KFC6k2EUu`
2. Make a new directory to play with in `/tmp`
3. Copy the data.txt file over
4. When you `cat` the file, you can see the file is of a [hexdump format](./hexdump.jpg)
5. Reverse the hexdump into the data file it was with `xxd -r`
6. Begin decompression depending on the file type you see
