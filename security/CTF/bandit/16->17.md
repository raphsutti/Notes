# Over The Wire: Bandit - 16->17

## Challenge

> The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which donâ€™t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it. Commands you may need to solve this level: ssh, telnet, nc, openssl, s_client, nmap


## Solution

### Initial log in and port scan
```
ssh bandit16@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

bandit16@bandit:~$ nmap -p31000-32000 localhost

Starting Nmap 7.40 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-03-23 01:53 CET
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.00040s latency).
Not shown: 996 closed ports
PORT      STATE SERVICE
31046/tcp open  unknown
31518/tcp open  unknown
31691/tcp open  unknown
31790/tcp open  unknown
31960/tcp open  unknown

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.11 seconds
```

### Submitting password to the port (incorrect port and correct port)
Note: correct port returns an RSA private key for the next level!
```
bandit16@bandit:~$ echo "cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd" | openssl s_client -connect localhost:31046 -quiet
140641184882752:error:141A10F4:SSL routines:ossl_statem_client_read_transition:unexpected message:../ssl/statem/statem_clnt.c:284:

bandit16@bandit:~$ echo "cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd" | openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 -quiet
depth=0 CN = localhost
verify error:num=18:self signed certificate
verify return:1
depth=0 CN = localhost
verify return:1
Correct!
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEogIBAAKCAQEAvmOkuifmMg6HL2YPIOjon6iWfbp7c3jx34YkYWqUH57SUdyJ
...
vBgsyi/sN3RqRBcGU40fOoZyfAMT8s1m/uYv52O6IgeuZ/ujbjY=
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

### Save the private key to a file and change read/write permission

Note: permission 600 was given (-rw-------) as this is a policy for ssh key to satisfy before use

```
bandit16@bandit: mkdir -p /tmp/taco
bandit16@bandit: cd /tmp/taco

bandit16@bandit:/tmp/taco$ echo "cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd" | openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 -quiet > key

bandit16@bandit:/tmp/taco$ chmod 600 key
```

### Use the key to ssh into bandit17

```
bandit16@bandit:/tmp/taco$ ssh -i key bandit17@localhost

bandit17@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit17
xLYVMN9WE5zQ5vHacb0sZEVqbrp7nBTn
```
