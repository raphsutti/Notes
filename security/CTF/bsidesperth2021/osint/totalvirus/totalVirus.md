# Total Virus

- **Category:** OSINT

## Challenge
A USB was recently recovered after a successful operation by defence force personnel.

The file is gone but we do have the hash though - 1f1d6aa5f683d7ebd346e591320cea275cca00c3ec0fdc7e2858ddfb1ed837e5

Can you find out if it was actually malicious?


## Solution
Google hash `1f1d6aa5f683d7ebd346e591320cea275cca00c3ec0fdc7e2858ddfb1ed837e5` reveals `FLAG{totally_not_a_virus}.exe`



Flag
```
FLAG{totally_not_a_virus}
```
