Slave Thou hast slain me Villain, take my purse If I ever Bury my body The letters 
which though find'st about me To Edmund Earl of Gloucester Seek him out upon the 
British Party O untimely death I know thee well A serviceable villain, as duteous 
to the vices of thy mistress As badness would desire What, is is he dead? Sit you 
down, Father, rest you  I am he as you are he as you are me And we are all together 
See how they run like pigs from a gun See how they fly I'm crying Sitting on a corn 
flake Waiting for the van to come Corporation T-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday Man 
you've been a naughty boy You let your face grow long I am the egg man They are 
the egg men I am the walrus Goo goo g'joob Mister City policeman sitting Pretty 
little policemen in a row See how they fly like Lucy in the sky, see how they run 
I'm crying, I'm crying I'm crying, I'm crying Yellow matter custard Dripping from 
a dead dog's eye Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess Boy, you've been a 
naughty girl, you let your knickers down I am the egg man They are the egg men I 
am the walrus Goo goo g'joob Sitting in an English garden Waiting for the sun If 
the sun don't come you get a tan From standing in the English rain I am the egg 
man (now good sir) They are the egg men (a poor man, made tame to fortune's blows) 
I am the walrus Goo goo g'joob, goo goo goo g'joob (good pity) Expert, texpert 
choking smokers Don't you think the joker laughs at you (ho ho ho, hee hee hee, 
hah hah hah) See how they smile like pigs in a sty, see how theysnide I'm crying 
Semolina Pilchard Climbing up the Eiffel tower Elementary penguin singing Hare K
rishna Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allen Poe I amthe egg man 
They are the egg men I am the walrus
