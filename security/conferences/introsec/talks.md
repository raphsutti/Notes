## IOC Dev 101 (James Hovious)

Indicator of Compromise
- artifact that suggest the presence of malicious activity
- used in combination with human analysis

Types of IOC
- Host based indicators (OS, file system)
- Network based indicators (HTTP headers, IP, domain name)

Use cases
- Real time (current compromise)
- Historical (previous compromise)
- Proactive hunting (before compromise)

Characterise IOC by describing:
- Fidelity (accuracy - true positive etc.)
  - True positive and True negative are what you want to work against
  - False positive - detected but benigned
  - False negative - did not detect, and malicious
- Robustness
  - Hashing is brittle
- Performance
  - How long does it take to match - may need to scale
  - How much memory consumed

IOC engines
- None
  - hash, IP, FQDN
- Yara
  - Match files with strings, byte patterns
  - Basic: C2 strings
  - Advanced: shellcode, .NET byte sequences
- Snort/Suricata
  - Network based indicators
  - HTTP headers, protocols
- OpenIOC
  - Advanced IOC matching
  - Include context

IOC dev methodology
- Multiple routes
  - Malware analysis (extract indicators)
  - Incident respons/Threat intel

1. Define requirements
2. Research threat
3. Acquire true positives
4. First pass IOC dev
5. Test assumptions
