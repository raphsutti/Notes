## Silvio - IoT exploit

Lots of money for 0day findings $5k+

Main router vendors: Netgear, D-Link, TP-Link, ASUS, Tenda

Process
- Get the software (firmware acquisition)
- Exploit

Firware acquisition
- Hardware level (NAND/Flash dumping, UARTm)
- HTTP firmware requrest MITM
- Vendor supplied public download

Non-destructive UART
- Interrupt boot loader
- If dropped in shell, copy to removable media

Non-destructive JTAG
- Access device interface
- Flash dump
- BUSSide
- Non-destructive Flash Dump
  - Without desoldering

Destructive chip-off dump

HTTP Person in the middle
- first boot, get firmware
- Set up SSID for IoT targets
- VLAN routed to pfsense
- Squid HTTP proxies and logs 

Vulnerability research

Approaches
- Code review
- Fuzzing / dynamic analysis
- Static analysis

Pwn2own 2020
- TP-link router
- Netgear Nighthawk R7800
- DLink

Trigger the bug and make it crash

Features = more technology, more attack surface

Increase technology into our lives. Maybe vendors will turn and go with less attack surface
